# designmodularizer
This is a working prototype of an modular design optimization tool in Grasshopper developed as a part of Caitlin Mueller's Structural Design Optimization class. I'm currently developing a new version that allows more user interactionn as my undegraduate thesis at MIT. 


modularizerFinal.gh is the prototype script and it will require Karamba3D license to run. The paper about this prototype is titled Approximating and Optimizing Designs with Modular Structures. Detailed documentation of this project can be found at http://johnhsrao.com/project/design-modularizer
